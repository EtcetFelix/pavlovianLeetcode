# pavlovianLeetcode
This project allows someone to leverage their gaming addiction to study more leetcode. It checks if a specific game (minecraft in this case) is running, calculates the time left to play, and exits the game if time runs out.
Time is added by requesting the user's leetcode statistics and adds 15 minutes for easy problems solved, 30 for medium, and 1 hour for hard problems. 
The idea is based upon pavlovian positive reinforcement training. The user will begin to associate leetcode problems with gaming sessions, wanting to solve more. 



How to run:
Open main.py with an editor and input your leetcode username where it says "leetcodeUsername"
Replace your "processToDelete" with whatever your favorite game process is called (e.g. minecraft may be javaw.exe, sims may be sims.exe or something)
Open a terminal and run main.py before starting to game.
